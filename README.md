# Plant_Monioring_Using_Tuya_Iot_cloud
In this tutorial we will learn how to make a plant monitoring system using Tuya cloud. This plant monitoring system is IOT based project.

Hi,
I hope you are doing well because a few days ago I recovered from the virus.
In the pandemic we all know how oxygen is important to our lives, we should have a plant pot at our house.
But in our busy life taking care of plants is a little difficult, we are not able to take care of them. Even when I go to the office in the early morning and after work, I do my youtube channelâ€™s work.

So I made a lot-based plant monitoring device. From this device, you can measure the condition of your plant from anywhere in the world. The device is able to measure temperature, humidity, and soil moisture, so if your plants look trusty you can serve water to them.
